# kraken-nf

Map metagenomic reads to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and estimate bacterial abundances.

## Usage

1. Set up nextflow as [described
   here](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted).
2. If you didn't run this pipeline in a while, possibly update nextflow itself.
   ```
   ./nextflow self-update
   ```
3. Then run the pipeline.
   ```
   ./nextflow run https://github.com/UnseenBio/kraken-nf
   ```
